Mobile Phone Distribution Software

The premise of our project is that we are a mobile phone network provider (similar to Meteor or Vodafone) that needs software to 
track the distribution of mobile phones from centres in the different countries that we operate in (Ireland, U.K., Spain, Germany,
and France (anywhere else? I just picked those at random)) and also to provide an interface for our branches in these countries to
buy stock.

Use Cases:

Server Side

getStock – From  manufacturer
moveStock – From one centre to another (if a certain type of stock has little demand in one centre but more in another)
addProduct – Add a product to the system (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S6)
removeProduct – Take a product that is no longer sold off the system
calculatePrice – Calculate price of product based on country taxes or applicable discounts

Client Side

buyProduct – From ‘us’
returnProduct – Return unsold stock? (This could then be moved by us to another country with moveStock use case?)
